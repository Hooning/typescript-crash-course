# Core Types of TypeScript

## number
* 1, 5.3, -10
* All numbers, no differentiation between integers or floats

## string
* 'Hi', "Hi", `Hi`
* All text values

## boolean
* true, false
* Just these two, no "truthy" or "falsy" values

## The key difference is: 
* JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime).
* TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development).
